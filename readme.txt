Basic casino game (only offline) 



---!Users
-wallet.py and adresses.py is stick with player class and player class generally takes action (CRUD)


---!JsonDatas
'''all the datas in game saved in this files not in a database'''
Users' classes manuplate those datas 

eventhough there is a efficency problem with saving json datas , i have learned with that project why database is important.



---!Games
in the future there will be lots of game and all of them will be online games
